Quantum Neural Network (QNN) built using hybrid quantum-classical machine learning techniques

This repository contains an implementation of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) built using hybrid quantum-classical machine learning techniques. The project explores how quantum circuits can be integrated with classical optimization methods to perform simple classification tasks.
